I am writing to express my strong support for the Stopping Tariffs on Allies and Bolstering Legislative Exercise of (STABLE) Trade Policy Act, introduced by Senators Tim Kaine and Chris Coons. The recent tariffs imposed by the administration are a deeply concerning policy decision that increases costs for American consumers and businesses. This legislation would ensure that Congress has the authority to review and reverse such tariffs, preventing unnecessary economic strain on American households.

For decades, economists across the political spectrum have warned about the negative consequences of tariffs. Protectionist trade measures have historically contributed to economic downturns, as seen during the Great Depression. Even advisors within the administration have voiced concerns over these policies. Congress must have a way to counteract decisions that place undue burdens on businesses and families.

Trade policies should strengthen our economy and reinforce relationships with our alliesâ€”not create unnecessary financial hardship. The STABLE Trade Policy Act is a critical step in ensuring that trade decisions reflect sound economic principles rather than unilateral action. I urge you to support this legislation and advocate for its swift passage.
